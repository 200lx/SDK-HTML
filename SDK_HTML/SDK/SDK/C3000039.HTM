<H3>CGA Mode 3, Zoom=81h (Nonstandard Text, 64x18 Color Zoom Mode) </H3><P>
When configured for this video state, the display memory organization is identical to that for the unzoomed Mode 3.  The display controller however is programmed to use a different size font, and to skip certain data on each scan line.  The effect is a 64x18 window into a logical page size that is 80x25.  Four logical pages of display memory are still available, color is enabled, and horizontal as well as vertical scrolling is possible to move the physical window around the logical page(s).  The character size is 10x11.  <P>
