<H1>Int 15h - System Services Interrupt </H1><P>
Int 15h provides a number of general services for HP palmtop applications.  Function 4Fh is found universally in all late model PCs, and allows applications to translate keys easily.  Function C0h provides a pointer to a system description table which describes the machine.  This table and function is also new, and is present across the IBM PC line, including the PS/2 machines.  If a call is made with a function code not listed in the table, Int 15h will return with AH = 86h and the carry flag set, indicating an error.  <P>
