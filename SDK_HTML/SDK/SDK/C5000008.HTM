<H3>Accessing System Manager Services From C </H3><P>
Each source file containing services calls must include the header file INTERFAC.H which contains macro definitions for each System Manager service.  The macro expands the call to be a call to a common System Service request function.  In addition, the macro adds a service number to the argument list and casts near pointers to far pointers as appropriate.  <P>
For example, the m_disp call in the source <P>
<PRE>
#include         &quot;interfac.h&quot; 
int              row, col, style, ostyle; 
char             *str; 
m_disp(x, y, str, strlen(str), style, ostyle); 
</PRE>
expands to
<PRE> 
c_service(F_M_DISP, x, y, (void far *)str, strlen(str), style, ostyle); 
</PRE>
where F_M_DISP is the function code for m_disp and is defined in INTERFAC.H.  <P>
The function c_service is provided in the object module CSVC.OBJ (which is in SCSVC_HP.LIB) and converts the call into a software interrupt that transfers control to the System Manager Dispatch table.  <P>
