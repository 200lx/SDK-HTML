<H3>HP 95LX Text Mode Compatibility </H3><P>
The HP 95LX Text Mode 7 was chosen to provide a platform on which off-the-shelf MDA software could run using the more limited HP 95LX display.  This HP 95LX mode is essentially a &quot;Zoom&quot; Text mode using a 6x8 font and a 40x16 window on a single 80x25 page.  This results in some level of incompatibility with true MDA Mode 7 in which the display would show the full 80x25 page.  Nevertheless, the HP palmtop adopts the same strategy.  HP palmtop's normal Video Mode 7 is a Zoom Text mode using a 16x12 font and a 40x16 window on a single 80x25 page.  However, the standard, unzoomed Video Mode 7 is also provided (Mode=7, Zoom=21h) to give the full 80x25 display using the standard 8x8 font.  <P>
