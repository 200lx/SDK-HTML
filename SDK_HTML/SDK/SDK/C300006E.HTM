<H1>Int 14h: Serial Port Services Interrupt </H1><P>
This service provides XT compatible support for the serial port.  BIOS serial port operations are performed only in a polled mode.  While the HP palmtop hardware supports serial port interrupts, the BIOS provides no support for interrupt-driven serial operations.  An application program can provide interrupt-driven support by writing directly to the serial port hardware.  <P>
The Serial Port Services interrupt (Int 14h) functions are described in the tables below.  Specify the desired function code in register AH, with additional parameters passed in other registers as indicated in the table.  <P>
