<H3>Text Mode Zoom </H3><P>
The Zoom feature provides an acceptable trade-off between eye strain and immediately available screen information.  It is possible to toggle between the Zoomed and Unzoomed state without altering the display data.  The Zoom column in the tables (CRTZOOM in the BIOS RAM Area) identifies the Zoom state of the display in modes 2,3, and 7.  Zoom is not implemented as a true Video mode, to avoid confusing DOS applications that would be unaware of this feature.  Zoom presents the display as a window in a logical page of 80x25.  For example, the (Mode=2, Zoom=84h) state is similar to the HP 95LX Text Mode 7 except that the data resides in the CGA frame buffer; four pages of data, instead of one, are available; and the character cell has finer resolution.  <P>
