<H3>Accessing System Manager Services From ASM </H3><P>
Assembler programs access the services by pushing any required arguments onto the stack and then using the SMCALL macro to &quot;call&quot; the service.  For example, usage of m_disp might appear as the following: <P>
<P>
<PRE>
include     interfac.mac 

... 


push        dx   ; ostyle (not actually used)
push        dx   ; style 
push        cx   ; string length 
push        ds   ; string segment 
push        si   ; string offset
push        ax   ; column 
push        bx   ; row 

SMCALL F_M_DISP  ; display the string 

add      sp,14   ; remove arguments from the stack

</PRE>
There are three things to note in this example: <P>
<UL><LI>The arguments are pushed in right-to-left order, as is done by C.  </LI><P>
<LI>Pointers are passed as far pointers.  See INTERFAC.H for argument specifics where, in general, pointers are cast as far pointers.  </LI><P>
<LI>The function numbers such as F_M_DISP and the SMCALL macro can be found in INTERFAC.MAC.  </LI><P>
</UL><B>Note:</B> it is very important that API2 be defined before #including interface.h or interface.mac, unless the program is a &quot;95-style&quot; program.  Either use <P>
<B>#define API2 </B><BR>
for a C program, or <BR>
<B>API2 equ 0 </B><BR>
for an assembly program.<P>
