This function is called if the DB_Open() returns a DB_MAYBEINUSE error.  The user should be prompted to continue, as using an already open database is a recipe for trouble.  DB_Reset resets the internal lock on the file so the next DB_Open will not fail.  DB_Reset should only be called for database files that have not been opened.  See DB_Open for more information.  <P>
