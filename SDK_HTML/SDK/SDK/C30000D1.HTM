<H1>Int 63h - Memory Mapping Functions </H1><P>
WARNING: These functions are for use by built-in software only.  They are documented for completeness, but they should not be used by applications since they are subject to change.  <P>
The Int 63h Memory Mapping services provide low-level program location and bank switching capabilities for the HP palmtop operating system.  <P>
The HP palmtop has eight 16Kbyte banks and one 64Kbyte bank.  The banks are referenced by a 16Kbyte page#.  The term physical page refers to memory in the address space of the CPU.  The term logical page refers to memory in an external device, like a memory chip.  <P>
Memory on an external device is viewed as a sequence of 16-KB logical pages.  The logical pages start on successive 16-KB boundaries starting with logical page 0 which starts at device address 0.
