<H3>DB_AutoGoto </H3><P>
This function performs an &quot;autogoto&quot; search (one executed by typing the first couple of characters of a field) in the first column indicated by the column arrangment.  <P>
If the first column happens to be the same as the first sort key in the viewpoint, an efficient binary search is used to find the string; otherwise, the search is sequential.  <P>
<I>Begin</I> and <I>end</I> give the range of records allowed for the search.  <P>
