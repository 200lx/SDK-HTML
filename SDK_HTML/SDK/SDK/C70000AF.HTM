<PRE><UL>
<LI>Syntax:      m_set_DOS_hot_key(int hotkey) </LI>
<LI>Parameters:  hotkey is the scan code replacing Ctrl+123 that you want to launch 
                    DOS with.  </LI>
<LI>Comments:    DOS is normally loaded by a special task called DOSTASK.  DOSTASK is 
             attached in the System Managers Task Control Block array to Ctrl+123.
             m_set_DOS_hot_key only changes the hot key that the System Manager uses
             to swap back to an already active DOS session.  To change the initial 
             launch key as well, you would need to change DOSTASK's hotkey in the 
             System Manager's Task Control Block as well.  

             The scan code for Ctrl+123 is 0xC200.  </LI>
