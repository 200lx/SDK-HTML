<H3>What is CAP?  </H3><P>
Examining some of the programs on the distribution disk will give you a good idea of how to use LHAPI applications to your advantage.  Unfortunately, some of those example applications may have been developed under &quot;CAP&quot;, which was a predecessor to LHAPI.  Therefore, you might see references like <B>#include &quot;cap2.h&quot;</B>, or <B>CAPBLOCK CapData</B> or <B>InitializeCAP();</B> These elements are vestiges of a former time--the best thing to do is use the examples as a stylistic guide, and don't get too worried if you see structure or function names that you don't recognize.  Almost all of the names have a direct equivalence--the file &quot;cap2.h&quot; contains the many #defines that map CAP names to LHAPI names.  <P>
