<H3>map_resource_file </H3>
This function maps the resource file specified by filename into system address space and returns the segment of the address space segment in DX for assembly language access (1-2-3).  
<PRE><UL>
<LI>Syntax:      int map_resource_file(char far *filename) </LI>
<LI>Parameters:  char far *filename - Name of resource file </LI>
<LI>Returns:     0 - if successful 
             1 - on failure </LI>
             If it fails, the System Manager will post an error message before 
             returning, so that the application need not display a hardcoded error 
             message (it is assumed that the System Manager's resource file has been 
             successfully loaded).  </LI>
