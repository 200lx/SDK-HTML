PathEdit is a subclass of edit that allows File Open Paths (and other &quot;default&quot; entry such as Search) to actively respond to ENTER.  <P>

PathEdit resends the ENTER key to the window as an F10 key.  Since the F10 key is normally reserved for terminating the dialog (e.g.  OK), pressing ENTER in the PathEdit terminates the dialog.  </LI><P>
