<H3>Multiple Print Screen Calls </H3><P>
Multiple Print Screen calls are ignored while a Print Screen operation is in progress.  This prevents multiple screen printouts from being queued if the [PrtSc] key is quickly pressed more than once.  The Print Screen service routine updates a status byte at address 40h:100h.  The value of this byte is interpreted as follows: <P>
<UL><LI>00h      No Print Screen activity.  </LI><P>
<LI>01h      A Print Screen operation is in progress.  </LI><P>
<LI>FFh     The previous Print Screen operation terminated with an error.  </LI><P>
