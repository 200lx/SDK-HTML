Record 1 <P>
Record 1 of TYPE_USER has the Single Occurrence Table.  This holds a date sorted list of records to help the appointment book quickly find the single-occurrence items for a given day.  There are SglOccurDayCount (in above record) entries in the table, and each one contains a date and record number: <P>
<pre>
     Array of SglOccurDayCount * { 
       0..2 Date (Year, Month, Day) See other document for format of bytes 
       3..4 Record Number int 
       } 
</pre>
The table's last has an indeterminate date and Record Number=-1.  <P>
The appointment book keeps track of the time order of records by using three types of linked lists.  The first list is given by the Single Occurrence Table (above).  Each entry in the Single Occurrence table is the head of a doubly-linked list of records for that day.  Each chain is sorted so that Events are first, then all appointments (sorted in ascending time order), then any todo's (only single occurrence todos; checked-off or todo's without carry over).  A visual example: <P>

</pre>
Next, all the multi-occurrence items are linked together in one long doubly-linked chain.  The head of the chain is given in the ApptBook Info structure FirstRptRecNo field.  These aren't sorted in any particular order, since the Apptbook internally generates the repeating occurrences, and interleaves them as necessary.  <P>
The next linked list is for each repeating todo with checked-off occurrences (stubs).  The "spawner" has a list of the dates of all deleted and checked-off occurrences at its end.  The stubs are represented by single-occurrence records, that for a given repeating todo (spawner) are chained together in a doubly linked chain.  The spawner points to the stub most recently checked off, and all stubs contain the record number of their spawner.  <P>
