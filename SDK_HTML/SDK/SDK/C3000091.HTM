<H3>AX = 6005h: Set Rate for Periodic Battery Measurements </H3><P>
Normally, the system measures the Main, BkUp, and Card batteries every 15 seconds.  This rate is stored in the RAM Variable [BATCKRATE] (55 msec units).  This service stores the new rate into [BATCKRATE] and the battery check counter [BATCKCNT].  If the value specified is zero, periodic battery measurements will be disabled.  <P>
<I>Warning: disabling battery measurements will make battery level reporting unreliable.  With depleted batteries, operating the palmtop with battery measurements disabled can result in loss of data without warning. </I> <P>
