<H1>Int 17h: Printer Services Interrupt </H1><P>
The Int 17h service routine supports one serial printer.  This is different from the standard PC-XT BIOS in which Int 17h drives a set of up to three parallel printers.  However, it is similar to the situation when the DOS command <P>
MODE LPT1:=COM1: <P>
is used to redirect LPT1 output of a PC to a serial printer.  In this case, MS-DOS redirects the Int 17h interrupt vector to point to an interrupt service routine that supports a serial printer.  <P>
