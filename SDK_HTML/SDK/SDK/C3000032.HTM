<H3>HP 95LX Graphics Mode Compatibility </H3><P>
Mode 20h provides some level of HP 95LX compatibility for graphics mode.  The HP 95LX display resolution is 240x128 and uses Mode 20h for graphics.  The HP 100LX BIOS Video Mode 20h will program the Display Controller to center a 240x128 window in the 320x200 display (2 dots per bit of data in the MDA Frame buffer).  <P>
