<H3>m_write_printer </H3>
This call sends the string pointed to by <I>bp</I> to the printer.  The string is expected to be composed of CP850 characters and of length <I>len</I>.  Any special sequences required to produce the specified characters on output (as determined by the active character translation table) are processed during this routine.

<LI>Syntax:      int m_write_printer(bp, len) </LI>
<LI>Parameters:  unsigned char far *bp - Pointer to the buffer containing the string of 
                                     CP850 characters to be printed </LI>
             If any translations are required, they will be performed before 
             transmission. unsigned int - len Length of string to be printed </LI>
<LI>Returns:     Number of characters sent to the printer </LI>
<LI>Comments:    The length of the source string should be compared to the return value 
             to verify the success of an m_write_printer call. If the return value is
             less than the source string length, the application should call 
             <A HREF="c70000c3.htm">m_close_printer</A> immediately to abort the print request. The System Manager
             does not flag an error if a mismatch in these two values occurs.</LI>
