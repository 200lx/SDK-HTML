<H3>Text Modes </H3><P>
If the application runs in a Text Video mode, the Display controller uses a word-wide font, in the given code page, loaded into the dedicated Bitmap buffer.  Frequently there will be other size fonts also loaded (to provide fast zoom).  Nonstandard BIOS Video services provide for maintenance of the Bitmap buffer.  <P>
