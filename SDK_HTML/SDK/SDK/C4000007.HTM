In-unit charging of NiCad main batteries is supported through the AC adaptor.  Charging commences when three conditions are met: <P>
<UL><LI>The adaptor is plugged in.  </LI><P>
<LI>Charging is enabled.  </LI><P>
<LI>NiCad batteries are specified.  </LI><P>
</UL>Charging stops when any one of the conditions becomes false or if the hardware detects overvoltage.  Overvoltage can sometimes occur if an attempt is made to charge Alkaline batteries.  Charging occurs at the &quot;fast&quot; rate for the first six hours, followed by charging at the &quot;slow&quot; rate thereafter (until stopped).  The transition from fast to SLOW charging occurs quietly without a BIOS message.  <P>
