This function either adds (MVP_ADD), removes (MVP_DELETE), or keeps but potentially reshuffles (MVP_MODIFY) an item in the current viewpt table.  This function checks the record against the current viewpoint filter to see if it should stay, and resorts it into the list.  The record must be read into memory into the
<I>src</I> buffer.  <P>
