The System Manager's Printer Services provide text character translation services for the HP palmtop supported printers, and enable printing via the serial port to an attached printer.  The printers supported by the HP palmtop's character translation tables include the Epson FX (0), HP LaserJet II (1), and IBM ProPrinter (2).  <P>
The active printer type may be selected by the user through the Setup application.  This selection determines which character translation table will be used for instructions on generating special characters and printer control sequences.  <P>
Character attributes for printing are defined in PRINTER.H.  <P>
