<H3>Some Limitations </H3><P>
The HP palmtop BIOS cannot differentiate between NiCad and Alkaline batteries; this information must be supplied to the BIOS by the application.  Battery Voltage, especially NiCad, is not always a good indication of remaining battery capacity.  There is no attempt to compensate for the internal resistance of the main batteries.  As a result, the measured voltage of the main batteries will be slightly higher when the AC adaptor is plugged in (no load on the batteries).  <P>
