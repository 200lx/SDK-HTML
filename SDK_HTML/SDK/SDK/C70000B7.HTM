This call prevents the editing or display of macros.  m_disable_macros must be called when SETUP enters the macro editor or whenever macros might be changed by executing code. 
If macro save or play is on when this call is made, m_disable_macros ends the current macro, saves it, turns off the macro function, and prevents it from being turned on until a call to m_enable_macros is made.  <P>
