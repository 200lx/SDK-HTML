<H3>m_get_static_block </H3>
This is the initial call to allocate a block of static RAM.
<PRE><UL>
<LI>Syntax:          int m_get_static_block(_far *_near *static_ptr, 
                                        unsigned long int DesiredBytes) </LI>
<LI>Parameters:      _far * _near * static_ptr - Near pointer to a far pointer
                 The System Manager sets the address pointed to by this parameter 
                 to the 32-bit buffer start address (offset always =0).
                 ulong int DesiredBytes - Desired size in bytes of the static block </LI>
<LI>Returns:         0 - if static memory block is successfully allocated 
                 The far pointer is returned to the start of the block. 
                 Any other value indicates an error condition.  Error code is stored in
                 AX.</LI>
