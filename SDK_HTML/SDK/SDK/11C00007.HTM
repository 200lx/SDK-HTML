<H3>DB_ChangePassword </H3><P>
This function changes the current password on the file.  Either a NULL pointer or a null string (&quot;&quot;) can be passed to indicate no password; both are equivalent.  Changing the password does garbage collection, so an DB_Undo cannot be executed immediately afterwards.  Changing the password requires rewriting all records in the database, and may take a while.  <P>
