<H3>DB_GetFieldStrings </H3><P>
DB_GetFieldStrings converts a group of fields (instead of just one) from the data record into strings. 
<I>srcrec</I> points to the preloaded record, <I>indextable</I> is an array of integers representing field indices,
<I>ptrtable</I> is a table of pointers that is loaded with the addresses of the strings, and
<I>indexcount</I> is the number of fields requested.  <P>
<I>buffer </I>and <I>bufsize </I>are used for &quot;temporary&quot; string creation.  <P>
If the fields asked for are already in string format, the pointers in ptrtable are just set to point into the srcrec.  If the fields are in a non-string format, then they are created in buffer, and ptrtable points to them there.  <P>
No errors are returned, and memory is not moved.  <P>
