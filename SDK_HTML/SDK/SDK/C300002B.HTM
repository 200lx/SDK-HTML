<H3>GPIO[13] (PSF) Interrupt </H3><P>
This is the Power Supply Failure interrupt.  The Hornet Low Power NMI interrupt is not capable of waking up the CPU if it is in the Light Sleep state.  The PSF interrupt provides such a wakeup, enabling the NMI interrupt to put the unit into BackUp mode shortly thereafter.  <P>
