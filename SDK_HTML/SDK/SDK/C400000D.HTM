<H3>Coldstart Behavior </H3><P>
Coldstart is invoked by [LSHFT][CTRL][ON] or, if the built-in RAM disk is found to be corrupted during normal power on.  It initializes the user RAM and built-in RAM disk, but not the plug-in RAM disk.  The user is prompted to specify whether or not to reformat the built-in RAM disk.  After all initializations are done, coldstart invokes Int 19h bootstrap loader.  <P>
