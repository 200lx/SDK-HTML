<H3>Real-Time Clock Interrupt </H3><P>
The Real-Time Clock hardware interrupt is intended to implement a software real time clock.  The interrupt can be set to wake up the CPU at time intervals of 1 second up to 388 days (26 bit, 1Hz timer*).  Some precautions are necessary when reading and writing values to the RTC hardware register to obtain reliable results.  <P>
(*) Note that this is a change from the HP 95LX.  <P>
