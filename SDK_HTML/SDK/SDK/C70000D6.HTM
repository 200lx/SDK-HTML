<H3>m_spawn </H3>
For this service to succeed, the calling application must be the only application in memory.  <P>
If the filespec identifies a .COM or a .EXE file, then the string should be null-terminated and <I>sysflag</I> should be 0.  If the filespec identifies a batch file, <I>sysflag</I> should be 1 and the string should be terminated with a newline character (0x0d).  
<PRE><UL>
<LI>Syntax:         int m_spawn(char far * file, int len, int sysflag, char far *message) </LI>
<LI>Parameters:     char far * file - Points to the fully qualified path of the file to be
                                  executed by COMMAND.COM 
                int len - Specifies the length of the path string 
                int sysflag1 = batch file
                
                               0 = other type of file, such as .COM or .EXE, as 
                                   specified in filespec 
                               2 = reserved for System Manager use; bypasses the 
                                   requirement that no other application be open 
                                   when invoked 
                char far *message - Points to a null-terminated string that will be
                                    displayed by the System Manager at the top of the
                                    screen prior to invoking the program </LI>
<LI>Returns:        0 - if successful 
                513 - if another application is active 
                DOS error code as returned by EXEC (INT 21h, AH == 4bh) - otherwise 
<LI>Related Calls:  This call replaces any reference to m_spawnarg.  </LI>
<LI>Comments:       For this service to succeed, the calling application must be the only 
                application in memory. 
                COMMAND.COM is always loaded for these requests, so that it may load 
                its exception handlers.  
                100LX/200LX applications should use m_action with the do_event field
                set to DO_FINI.  See m_action for details.  </LI>
