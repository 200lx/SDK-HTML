<H3>m_asound </H3>
This call generates one of several various sound patterns, as specified by <I>index</I>.  There are ten (0-9) supported patterns.  The first four (0-3) are used to generate tones for 1-2-3.  These sounds roughly match 1-2-3 sounds generated on an 8 MHz IBM AT .  (Note that 1-2-3 sounds are clock- dependent.) The remaining six sounds are more complicated alarm sounds.
