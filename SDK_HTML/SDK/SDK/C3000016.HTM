<H3>Fn Key </H3><P>
The [Fn] key works like a special function key.  If Fn is active, it changes the operation of most of the keyboard.  Its purpose is to assist in producing many of the keyboard results possible with the larger standard PC keyboards.  In addition, many special characters may be generated directly with the use of the [Fn] key (see the character code tables at the end of this section).  <P>
Several keys available on a full size PC keyboard are available on the HP 100LX keyboard as Fn-Shifted keys (e.g.; Scroll Lock, INS, HOME, PGDN, PGUP, END, PRT SC).  Other HP palmtop-unique keys are Fn-Shifts (e.g.; Zoom, Date, Time, Cut, Copy, Paste).  <P>
The [Fn] key also activates &quot;Mute&quot; functions, special key sequences that return many non-English characters.  See the table of mute functions at the end of this section.  <P>
The [Fn] key is &quot;sticky.&quot; Pressing and releasing [Fn] causes the Fn function to stay on; pressing and releasing a second time causes the Fn function to turn off.  If the Fn state is on but the Fn key is released, then pressing and releasing most other keys causes the Fn state to turn off.  <P>
