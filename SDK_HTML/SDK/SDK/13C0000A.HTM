<H3>Socket Services 1.01 </H3><P>
The HP palmtop contains an implementation of Socket Services 1.01.  <P>
From Socket Services viewpoint, the HP palmtop has one adapter (number 0) and the adapter has one socket (number 1), which is the PCMCIA card slot.  Socket Services has no knowledge of other devices in the system such as System ROM.  This means that there are necessarily some special considerations.  For example, the GetWindow function cannot return the true window state if the window is currently mapped to System ROM since System ROM is not a socket.  <P>
The Socket Services Status Change Callback goes to its client, CardBIOS.  Since Socket Services is not designed to have multiple clients, it is recommended that applications register as clients of CardBIOS to obtain card change events.  See the CICDEMO program discussed below.  <P>
It is expected that CICDEMO will provide a sufficent illustration of Socket Services usage for most application's needs.  However, complete Socket Services 1.01 documentation is available upon request (note that it is no longer available from the PCMCIA).  <P>
Here are some notes on selected HP100LX/HP200LX Socket Services functions (all this information is available by calling the appropriate Socket Services Inquire functions): <P>

Notes: <P>
<UL><LI>Vpp1 and Vpp2 must always be the same.  </LI><P>
<LI>Only Ready Change and Card Detect Change interrupts are currently available.  The Cougar hardware also supports interrupts from Battery Low or Dead change, but these are not being enabled.  The card battery state is read every 15 seconds at the same time the main and backup batteries are measured.  If the card battery is low or dead, a message is displayed.  </LI><P>
<LI>When a socket is configured as Memory and the Ready Change interrupt is enabled, this interrupt comes in on IRQ6.  </LI><P>
<LI>When the built-in applications are active, ALL of the 9 memory windows are in use for XIP code and data.  The term System Manager will be used for the built-in applications.  </LI><P>
The XIP code and data are mapped in from the System ROM.  The System ROM is not controlled by Socket Services, but is instead accessed by proprietary memory mapping functions on Int 63h.  <P>
In order for the System Manager and memory cards to coexist, all utilities which access a memory card must save and restore the window(s) so that from the System Manager's point of view, the System Manager has exclusive use of the windows.  <P>
No program on the 100LX/200LX, including the System Manager, is allowed to store a hardware interrupt handler in a memory window.  Thus, code such as disk drivers which do temporary mapping from a memory card, do NOT need to worry about interrupts during the time the window mapping is changed.  <P>
CardBIOS takes care of saving and restoring window mappings so it is recommended that CardBIOS be used to read/write cards whenever possible.  It is hoped that this will cover the need to configure I/O cards.  <P>
</UL>
<UL><LI>Neither of the two I/O windows are normally in use on the HP100LX/200LX.  Hence, they are for exclusive use of plug-in I/O cards.  </LI><P>
The natural address to use for a UART card is 2F8h (COM2).  <P>

1 Due to a hardware limitation, the wait states must be at least 1 for an I/O access.  Hence, the 100 ns speed is not supported for I/O cards.  <P>
2 Due to a hardware limitation, WAIT line monitoring does not work with fewer than 3 wait states.  Thus, if WAIT line monitoring is requested, Socket Services will set 3 wait states.  With 3 or more wait states, WAIT line monitoring will be active.  <P>
</UL>
<UL><LI>The HP palmtop's wait states are associated with a chip enable (e.g., the plug-in card or System ROM) rather than being associated with a window.  Hence, some extra work is done in Socket Services to attempt to avoid the potential problem where there are two windows open on the same chip enable and the two windows want different access speeds.  Basically, it remembers what is requested, but it never sets fewer wait states than other enabled windows on the same chip enable.  </LI><P>
