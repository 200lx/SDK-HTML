<H3>IR Interrupt </H3><P>
The Infra-Red hardware can be configured to operate independently from the UART.  IR events can be made to trigger IRQ2 interrupts if properly enabled.  The BIOS installs a dummy IR handler that resets the display timeout, clears the IR source bit, and acknowledges the interrupt at the 8259 PIC.  <P>
