This function appends a record to the next available record.  The integer returned is the number of the record written to.  Note that since DB_WriteRecord appends if the record is past existing records, this function is implemented through a call to DB_WriteRecord.  The record is marked as modified for reconciliation.  See &quot;DB_WriteRecord&quot; for possible errors.  <P>
