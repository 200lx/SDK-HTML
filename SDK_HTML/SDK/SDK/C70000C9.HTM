This call translates a single CP850 character to the sequence required by the selected printer to produce the equivalent character, and stores the result in the specified buffer.  This routine is provided for use by applications that do their own printer communications.  The specified buffer must be at least 48 bytes long.

<LI>Parameters:     unsigned char ch A - single CP850 character to be converted according 
                                     to the active character translation table 
                unsigned char far *bp - Pointer to a buffer - at least 48 bytes long-to

<LI>Returns:        The number of characters in the buffer
