This function removes unused records in the database.  Collecting garbage resets the Undo point (see the following section describing DB_Undo).  This happens automatically when the database file is closed.  Garbage collection may need to be called at strategic points to prevent disk files from growing too large.  After garbage collection, any deleted record numbers will be reclaimed.  The DOS file buffer is flushed after garbage collection.  <P>
