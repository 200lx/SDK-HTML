User applications can define their own record types starting at type TYPE_USER.  Record types should be sequential (TYPE_USER, TYPE_USER+1, etc.) and each application is limited to 17 user-defined record types.  User record types are useful for configuration information or special tables, but note that they cannot appear in viewpoints.  <P>
