<H3>Sticky Shift </H3><P>
The [Shift] key is also &quot;sticky.&quot; It works much like the Fn key: pressing and releasing [Shift] causes the Shift state to stay on, and pressing and releasing a second time causes the shift state to turn off.  If the Shift state is on but the shift key is released, then pressing and releasing any other key causes the shift state to turn off.  <P>
