<H3>DB_ParseFISL </H3><P>
DB_ParseFISL parses a FISL string at <I>InFISL</I> and puts the resulting token string at
<I>OutTOKEN</I>.  Any error condition sets the integer pointed to by
<I>OutExpLen</I> to the character position where the error was first recognized.  If the parsing was successful,
<I>OutExpLen</I> is set to the length of the token string returned.  <P>
<UL><LI><Pre>Syntax:             int DB_ParseFISL(DBBLOCK *dblk,char far *InFISL,
                    char far *OutTOKEN, int OutBufSize, int *OutExpLen); </LI><P>
<LI>Returns:            DB_OK          Expression parsed ok.  <P>
                    DB_SYNTAX      Syntax error in expression.  <P>
                    DB_OVERFLOW    Expression was too large for specified 
                                   buffer or usertype subexpression was too 
                                   large for internal buffer.  <P>
                    DB_TYPEMISMATCH Comparisions made between non-compatible 
                                    types.  <P>
                    DB_COMPLEX     Expression was too complex to be parsed.  <P>
