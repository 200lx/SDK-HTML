<H3>CGA Mode 6 (High Resolution B&amp;W Graphics) </H3><P>
When configured for CGA Mode 6 the display memory is organized as 200 scan lines consisting of 640 bits each.  Each byte in the scan line corresponds to eight contiguous pixels in the display.  The most significant bit in each byte corresponds to the leftmost displayed pixel.  The scan lines are interleaved in memory with all of the even-numbered scan lines contiguous and starting at the base address B8000h.  The odd-numbered scan lines are contiguous and start at base address BA000h.  <P>
