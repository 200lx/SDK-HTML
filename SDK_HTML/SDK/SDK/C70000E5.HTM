                K      Enable user termination if keystroke entered
                       The default is user termination enabled.  The range is 0-1. 
                       A value of 1 indicates user termination enabled. 

                L      Length of note 
                       The range is 1-64, where 64 = 1/8 note, 32 = 1/4 note, etc.
                       The default is 8 (whole note).  

                M      Music play style; default = N; range: 
                       N - Normal 
                       L - Legato 
                       S - Staccato 

                N      An alternate way to play a note from the 8 octave scale.  
                       Range 0-84. (Default = 0.) The number is divided by 12 to 
                       determine the octave.  The remainder is the note to be played: 
                       Remainder 0 = C 
                       1 = C#      4 = E      7 = G       10 = A#
                       2 = D       5 = F      8 = G#      11 = B
                       3 = D#      6 = F#     9 = A

                O      Octave; sets the current octave for all subsequent notes;
                       default = 4; range 0-7 

                P      Pause; pause between notes; range 1-64 
                       The length of pause is determined in the same manner as the length
                       of note (L).  
        
                T      Tempo (pace of music)
