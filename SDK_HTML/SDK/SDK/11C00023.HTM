<H3>DB_CardToFISL </H3><P>
This function takes the fielddef referred to by index and a pointer to a data buffer typically pointed to by a card window.  Converts the result into a valid FISL string; appends to an existing FISL string by &quot;&amp;&quot; if there is already a string there.  This function is used by the database application to convert a Card Subset Definition into a &quot;SSL&quot; (FISL) string for subsetting.  The data buffer pointed to by fielddata can prefixed by *, -, =, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, or &lt;&gt; to more specifically control the FISL string generated (see the User's Manual).  <P>

                    char far *fielddata, char far *fislbuffer,

                    DB_OVERFLOW    FISL buffer provided was too small to 
                                   hold the result.  <P>
                    DB_COMPLEX     Internal error caused resulting string
