If the video mode is Text, this function returns the character and attribute bytes at the current cursor location.  If the display is in graphics mode, it attempts a match on the bit pattern against the resident 8x8 byte wide font.  If a match is found, it will return the character (no attribute), otherwise it returns AL=0.  In text modes that support multiple pages, characters may be fetched from pages not currently in the display.  <P>
