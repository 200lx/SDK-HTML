This call decrements the system lock count.  If calls are not nested, it allows the system to take control from the current application.

<LI>Syntax:         void m_unlock(void) </LI>
<LI>Parameters:     None </LI>
<LI>Returns:        None </LI>
<LI>Related Calls:  <A HREF="c70000d4.htm">m_lock</A> </LI>
<LI>Comments:       This call (and its complement, m_lock) work by 
                decrementing/incrementing the lock counters.  Correct nesting is 
                therefore required for use.  For example, two successive m_lock() 
                calls, followed by a single m_unlock() call, will still leave the 
                lock on.  </LI>
