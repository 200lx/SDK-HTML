<H1>Int 06h: BIOS Hook </H1><P>
In the HP palmtop, the BIOS hook is called at several locations in the BIOS to provide the opportunity for applications to modify or customize certain aspects of BIOS processing.  In the HP 95LX, this interrupt is called at four places in the BIOS code to provide the opportunity for applications to modify the Sleep mode behavior.  The HP palmtop provides additional calls, but remains compatible with the original HP 95LX usages.  <P>
