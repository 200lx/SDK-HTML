<H3>Special Fn Key </H3><P>
All of the HP palmtop's 80 keys produce scancodes sent to Int 09h with the exception of the nonstandard [Fn] key.  This key behaves much like the shift keys, causing a flag to be set or reset indicating whether or not the Fn modifier is active.  Unlike the shift keys' behavior, this key's action takes place in the code that invokes Int 09h, not inside Int 09h.  <P>
